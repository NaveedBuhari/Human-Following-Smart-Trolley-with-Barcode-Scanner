# 🛒 Human Following Smart Trolley with Barcode Scanner

An autonomous, human-following smart trolley integrated with barcode scanning technology, developed to enhance the shopping experience — particularly for elderly and mobility-impaired individuals. The trolley autonomously tracks shoppers using UV and IR sensors and provides real-time billing updates via an OLED display by scanning products placed inside.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional shopping carts require manual effort and lack real-time cost tracking. This system addresses these challenges by introducing an autonomous trolley that:
- Follows the user without manual control
- Scans product barcodes as items are added
- Calculates and displays real-time pricing
- Provides ease of shopping for elderly and differently-abled individuals

The project successfully integrates automation, navigation, and billing transparency in one affordable system.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Components Used

- **Hardware**: Ultrasonic Sensor, IR Sensor, UV Sensor, Barcode Scanner, OLED Display, Motors, Battery
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino
- **Software**: Embedded C (Arduino IDE), Database management for product lookup
- **Display**: OLED for real-time cost tracking

## 🧩 Key Modules

- **Proximity Sensing Module**: UV and IR sensors detect and follow the shopper in real-time.
- **Direction Control Module**: Processes sensor data to determine movement and navigation.
- **Barcode Scanning Module**: Scans products as they are placed into the trolley.
- **Database Lookup Module**: Fetches product name and price from a database.
- **Display Module**: Shows product details and cumulative cost on an OLED screen.
- **Trolley Movement Module**: Motor control with obstacle detection and avoidance.

## 🖥️ System Workflow

1. Shopper walks into the store with the trolley.
2. The trolley follows the shopper autonomously using UV and IR sensing.
3. As products are added, their barcodes are scanned automatically.
4. The trolley updates the cost in real-time on the OLED screen.
5. Shopper can continuously monitor total expenditure and manage their budget.
